		<h1><u>Conversion Factors</u></h1>
		<p>From the introduction, we learned that from an <strong>equivalence statement</strong>, it's possible to make a fraction which equals 1.</p>

			<u><h2>The Conversion Box</h2></u>
			<p>The <strong>conversion box</strong> is a nifty way to keep track of units. The box represents a series of fractions being multiplied together - things on the top half represent numerators, while things on the bottom half represent denominators.</p>
			<p>For example, this fraction below... <img src="conversions-images/1.png" alt="Fractions 1" class="hover"> can be represented as this table... <img src="conversions-images/2.png" alt="Box 1" class="hover"></p>
			<p>To solve the equation when it is in separate fractions, you multiple all the numbers on the top from left-to-right, then do the same thing with the numbers on the bottom. 1 * 3 * 6 = 18 and 2 * 4 * 3 = 24; 18 over 24 then reduces to 3 over 4.</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/3.png" alt="Solve Fractions 1" class="hover">
			<p>A similar approach is taken when working with the box method - all of the numbers on the top are multipled together, all of the numbers on the bottom are multiplied together, and then the top is divided by the bottom. Like we saw before, 1 * 3 * 6 = 18 and 2 * 4 * 3 = 24; 18 over 24 becomes 3 over 4.</p>

			<u><h2>Back to Square 1</h2></u>
			<p>At this point, you might be asking yourself, "What does this have to do with the introduction?". Well, let's consider this problem:</p> 
			<p>If there are 16 ounces in 1 pound, then how many ounces are in 3.5 pounds?</p>
			<p>The first thing we're going to do is pick out the number which isn't an equivalency statement. In this problem, "16 ounces in 1 pound" is an equivalency statement, so we're going to use "3.5 pounds" instead. We're then going to put it in a box, like so:</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/5.png" alt="Practice 1" class="hover">
			<p>The next thing to consider is the empty box on the bottom - <strong>whenever a number is "mising", assume that there's an invisible 1</strong>. In this case, "3.5 pounds" is being divided by an invisible "1".</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/6.png" alt="Practice 2" class="hover">
			<p>Recall that the original problem wants us to get from pounds to ounces. So, we have to figure out how to get from pounds to ounces.</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/7.png" alt="Practice 3" class="hover">
			<p>Here's the thing - as we saw in the introduction, <strong>a fraction with the same numbers on top and bottom cancel out to equal 1</strong>. We also saw before that we can make fractions out of the equivalency statement because they equal 1:</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/10.png" alt="Equivalence" class="hover">
			<p>Bearing this in mind, we need to use a fraction which can cancel out "lbs" in the numerator - thus, we need to use "16 oz over 1 lb", since putting "lbs" in the denominator will cancel out the "lbs" in the numerator. This will result in the following:</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/8.png" alt="Practice 4" class="hover">
			<p>Multiplying 3.5 by 16 gives 56; therefore, the answer to this problem is 56 ounces.</p>
			<img src="conversions-images/9.png" alt="Practice 5" class="hover">
			<p>This wraps up how to use the conversion box! Next up is <a href="mole.html">The Mole</a>, in which we will be taking our first look at stoichiometry. You can also review the <a href="index.html">Introduction</a> if you need to. Good luck and happy converting!</p>
